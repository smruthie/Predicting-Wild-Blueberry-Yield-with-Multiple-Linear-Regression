# Using Multiple Linear Regression to Predict Wild Blueberry Yield

The "Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Data" has a couple of potential predictors of Wild Blueberry yield and the resulting yields, a simulation dataset produced from a Wild Blueberry Pollination Model. In other words, this is not a real-life dataset, but generated through a simulation model authenticated by field observations and experimental data accumulated over several years. This dataset was taken from a research entitled "Wild blueberry yield prediction using a combination of computer simulation and machine learning algorithms," which attempts to shed light into the possibility that simulation data can also be useful for crop yield predictions besides real-life data for machine learning. I ran a multiple linear regression (MLR) on this data with choosing clone size, presence of honey bees, presence of bumble bees, presence of andrena, presence of osmia bees, raining days, fruit set, fruit mass, seeds, and maximum upper temperature range as best predictors of Wild Blueberry yield in the model with a R2 value of 0.99.
